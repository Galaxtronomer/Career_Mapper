# Career Mapper

Career Mapper is a web-based interactive career mapping tool built using **Python** and **Leaflet.js**.

It allows you to:
- 🗺️ Add, move, and remove location drops on the map (e.g., city of your college/university/institute).
- ✍️ Add, edit, rotate, and remove custom text labels (e.g., name of your college/university/institute).
- ➰ Draw curves with arrows between points (e.g., show your movements from one place to another).
