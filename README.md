# Career Mapper

This is a **web-based interactive career map editor** built using Python and Leaflet.js.  
It allows you to:

- Add, move, and remove location drops on the map [e.g., city of your college/university/institute].  
- Add, edit, rotate, and remove custom text labels [e.g., name of your college/university/institute].  
- Draw curves with arrows between points [e.g., show your movements from one place to other].
